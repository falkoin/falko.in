Since I really like reading about/watching videos of other peoples setups and I am
someone, who tinkeres a lot with his setup, here is my take for this kind of post.  
I work with a monitor plus laptop.
The monitor is a Dell with a 4k resolution, USB-C and a wobbly stand.
Which pretty much sums up the good and the bad.
To be a little more in depth: I run the monitor at a scaling resolution of 2560x1440p handled by the OS,
which is not real "retina", but sharp enough for my eyes.
I really like, that it supports the one cable via USB-C solution.
Unfortunately, if you run the monitor in 4k 60 Hz and RGB mode you don't get USB 3 speeds, when using the monitors hub.
The color accuracy is ok'ish and the stand is really terrible.
It works fine if the height is pretty low and gets more and more instable the higher you set the monitor.
Since I am using a height adjustable desk, I often use the monitor in almost max height, which makes it wobble a lot.
